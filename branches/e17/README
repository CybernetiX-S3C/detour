detour 0.5.1

Detour is is a graphical themed interface for the upcoming Enlightenment-DR17 desktop shell. Detour has been in the works since March of 2005, it began as a port of the Enlightenment-DR16 detroit theme. So many changes have occurred since, that it was no longer a port, rather it became a detour.
